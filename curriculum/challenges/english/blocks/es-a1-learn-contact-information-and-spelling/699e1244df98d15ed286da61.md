# --description--

`Otro` (masculine) and `otra` (feminine) are used to talk about an additional or different thing. For example:

- `Quiero otro café.` – I want another coffee. (`Café` is masculine, that's why `otro` is used here).

- `Necesito otra copia.` – I need another copy. (`Copia` is feminine, that's why `otra` is used here).

When confirming things, you'll often hear `otra` combined with `vez`.

`Vez` means an occasion or time something happens. It is a feminine noun. Because `vez` is feminine, the expression always uses the feminine form:

`Puedes repetirlo otra vez?` - Can you repeat it again?

This common expression is used to talk about doing something one more time or again.

`Otra vez` combines:
