<!-- (Audio) Basti: ¿Puedo usar mi apodo? -->

# --description--

Do you remember verbs are conjugated according to the person they are refering to? If not, now you do!

A couple of tasks ago, you learned how to use the verb `poder` to ask if someone was able to do something for you.

Now you'll learn how to conjugate this same verb to ask if **you** can do something. You just need to use the structure:

`Puedo` + infinitive verb + `...?`

Let's see some examples:

- `¿Puedo usar la computadora?` - Can I use the computer? 

- `¿Puedo usar mi apodo?` - Can I use my nickname? 

In both examples, you are asking for permission to use the computer and your nickname, respectively.

# --explanation--

Basti says `¿Puedo usar mi apodo?`.

Here, `puedo` is the first person singular form of the verb `poder`, used when someone asks for permission.

The structure follows the pattern:

`¿Puedo` + infinitive verb + `...?`

In this case:

- `Usar` means to use.

- `Mi apodo` refers to his nickname.

So Basti is asking if he is allowed to use his nickname.
