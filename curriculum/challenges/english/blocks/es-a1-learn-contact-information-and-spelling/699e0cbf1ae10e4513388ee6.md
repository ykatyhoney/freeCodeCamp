<!-- (Audio) Camila: ¿Y el tuyo, Mateo? -->

# --description--

In Spanish, possessive pronouns are used to talk about something that belongs to someone.

`Mío` or `mía` refers to something that belongs to the speaker, while `tuyo` or `tuya` refer to something that belongs to the other person. For example:

- `Es mío.` - It's mine. (Masculine) 

- `Es mía.` - It's mine. (Feminine)

- `Es tuyo` - It's yours. (Masculine)

- `Es tuya` - It's yours. (Feminine)

`Tuyo` and `tuya` are the possessive pronouns for the second person singular (`tú`). You can use it when speaking to one person informally.

Spanish often uses possessive pronouns to avoid repeating the noun when it is already clear from context.
