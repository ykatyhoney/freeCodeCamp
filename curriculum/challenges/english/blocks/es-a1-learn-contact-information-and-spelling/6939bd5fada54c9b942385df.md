<!-- (Audio) Basti: Sí, Gómez termina en z. -->

# --description--

In this task, you will hear Basti clarifying some personal details. 

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below. 

# --questions--

## --text--

What question is Basti answering?

## --answers--

Does your last name Gómez end with an `s`?

### --feedback--

Basti is confirming a different letter.

---

Is your middle name Sebastián?

### --feedback--

Basti is not being asked about his middle name.

---

Does Gómez end with a `z`?

---

Can you repeat your last name?

### --feedback--

That would be a different type of request — asking to repeat, not confirm a specific letter.

## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

Basti starts his sentence with the word `Sí`, which is a confirmation, followed by `Gómez termina en z`. So, it's safe to assume the person asked if Goméz ends with `z`. Otherwise, he would be correcting the person.
