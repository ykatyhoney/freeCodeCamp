<!-- (Audio) Mateo: ¿Puedes repetirlo? -->

# --description--

`Poder` is a very common verb for polite requests. It means to be able to do something.

Verbs in Spanish change form depending on the person you are talking to. When you ask someone if they are able to do something, you need to conjugate the main verb.

Let's say you want to ask one person if they can help you, you could say:

`¿Puedes hablar más despacio?` - Can you speak more slowly?

Notice that `poder` is conjugated to its second person singular (`tú`) form: `puedes` while the following verb stays in the infinitive form. So the common pattern is:

`¿Puedes` + infinitive verb + `...?`
