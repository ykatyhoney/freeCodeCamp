# --explanation--

The correct answer is `¿Puedes repetirlo?` because it is the question used to politely ask someone to say something again.

It follows the common request pattern:

`¿Puedes` + infinitive + `...?`

`Puedes` comes from `poder` and is used to make a polite request.

`Repetir` means to say something again.

The ending `-lo` refers to the information already mentioned.

The other options ask for personal information (name, surname, or email), not for repetition.
