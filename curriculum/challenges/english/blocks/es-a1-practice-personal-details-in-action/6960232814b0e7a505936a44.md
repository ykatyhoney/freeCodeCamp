# --explanation--

Each question word is used for a different communicative purpose in Spanish.

`¿Cómo te llamas?` is used to ask for someone's name. Here, `cómo` introduces the question using the verb `llamarse`.

`¿Cuál es tu apellido?` is used to ask for specific information. `Cuál` is commonly used when requesting identifying details such as names, numbers, or emails.

`¿Puedes repetirlo?` is a polite request. `Puedes` comes from the verb `poder` and is used in the structure:

`¿Puedes` + infinitive + `...?`

This pattern is commonly used to ask someone to do something politely.
